# Predicting-customers-likelihood-to-churning
To predict likelihood of customers leaving a brand
Project description: This model predicts the likelihood of customers churning.

Project architecture: A few models were developed using different classifiers and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model. The Gradient boosted decision tree, Random Forest classifier and Decision tree, turned out to produce better performance than others.

Data source: The data was provided by BT as a similar version to what is used.

Model evaluation: The models were evaluated using five different metrics; accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix and f1-score. The results were visualized using matplotlib and seaborn
